# Introduction

This is the documentation for the `Djapy` library, which is designed to let you make RESTful APIs
within Django with as no boilerplate, using plain Python and Django, with the supremacy of Pydantic.

Djapy is molded according to `Django`'s philosophy of "batteries included", and is designed to
be as simple as possible to use, while still being powerful enough to handle most use cases.

```python
@djapify
def get_user(request) -> {200: UserSchema, 404: str}:
    return request.user
```

> It's that simple!
