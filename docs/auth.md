# Auth, well that's a thing

Authentication is super critical for any application.
It's the process of verifying the identity of a user. In this section, we'll cover how to authenticate users in your
application.

## Session Authentication

Session authentication is the default authentication mechanism for Django, and Djapy supports it out of the box.

To use session authentication, you need to import `SessionAuth` from `djapy.auth` and utilize it in your views.

```python
from djapy import SessionAuth


@djapy_auth(SessionAuth, permissions=['plans.todos.can_view'])
def todo_list(request):
    ...
```

or if you wanna assign authentication to the all endpoints in your `views.py` file, you can use `AUTH_MECHANISM`
variable.

```python
AUTH_MECHANISM = SessionAuth(permissions=['plans.todos.can_view'])
# or just SessionAuth
```

## Extending Base Authentication

You can extend the base authentication mechanism to create your own custom authentication mechanism.

Here's an example of how you can do that:

```python
from djapy import BaseAuthMechanism


class CustomAuth(BaseAuthMechanism):
    def __init__(self, permissions):
        self.permissions = permissions

    def authenticate(self, request):
        # Your custom authentication logic here
        return True

    def authorize(self, request):
        # Your custom authorization logic here
        return True

    def schema(self):
        return {}  # Your custom schema here to be used in the swagger documentation

    def app_schema(self):
        return {}  # Your custom app schema here to be used in the swagger documentation
```
